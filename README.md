# sshd-lite

A feature-light Secure Shell Daemon `sshd(8)` written in Go (Golang). **Warning, this is beta software**.

### Install

**Binaries**

See [the latest release](https://github.com/jpillora/sshd-lite/releases/latest)

**Source**

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/sshd-lite
```

### Features

* Cross platform single binary
* No dependencies
* Remote shells
* Authentication (`user:pass` and `authorized_keys`)

### Usage

```
$ sshd-lite --help
```

<tmpl,code: go run main.go --help>
```

	Usage: sshd [options] <auth-type>

	Version: 0.0.0

	Options:
	  --host, listening interface (defaults to all)
	  --port -p, listening port (defaults to 22, then fallsback to 2200)
	  --shell, the type of to use shell for remote sessions (defaults to bash)
	  --keyfile, a filepath to an private key (for example, an 'id_rsa' file)
	  --keyseed, a string to use to seed key generation (if no key file
	  is provided, keyseed defaults to a random seed)
	  --version, display version
	  -v, verbose logs

	<auth-type> must be set to one of:
	  1. a username and password string separated by a colon ("user:pass")
	  2. a path to an ssh 'authorized_keys' file ("~/.ssh/authorized_keys")
	  3. "none" to disable client authentication - very insecure

	Notes:
	  * Once authenticated, clients will have access to a shell of the
	  current user. Currently, sshd-lite does not lookup system users.
	  * sshd-lite does only supports remotes shells. no tunnelling or
	  single-command execution.

### Todo

* Add windows support using PowerShell?
* Automatically re-parse `auth` file
